# Fintech Case Study: Blockchain within IBM

## How IBM Foodtrust Utilizes Blockchain to the Advantage of the Food Industry

---

<p> IBM Foodtrust was created in August 2017 with ten participating members. These members were companies across the globe that wanted to utilize new technology in the tracking and processing of food services and systems. The Foodtrust creates a more accountable and streamlined food ecosystem, with the potential to save up to 31 billion USD by 2024. IBM Foodtrust is obviously a service provided by IBM. IBM was created in 1911 with the merger of four seperate companies, orchestrated by financier Charles Flint. In 2019 IBM had an annual revenue of up to 71 billion dollars and it is a publicly traded company. It's top four mutual fund holders include VTSMX, VFINX, SPY, and FXIAX and the market value of these four holders are upwards of 7 billion dollars. Some companies that participate in IBM Foodtrust are Nestle and Dole. <p>

##Business Activities

<p> The IBM Foodtrust is meaning to solve a few problems. Overall, it's intention is to save businesses money, while tracing food origins and the supply chain on which these items are processed and transported. Using multiple technologies, The Foodtrust can monitor food handling and storage, including temperatures and times at which sensitive product is held. This information can then be communicated not just to the supplier, but the reciever as well. IBM is using blockchain technology to accomplish this. By using the blockchain, The Foodtrust is protecting company information while simultaneously allowing its members to access multiple points of data along the transportation and shipping process. This platform will also utlize smart contracts, which go hand in hand with blockchain. The IBM Blockchain performs on Hyperledger Fabric, provided by The Linux Foundation. IBM Blockchain is deployed on Red Hat OpenShift, which is Red Hat's kubernetes platform.  They are also using IoT technology to process and relay this information to their own private blockchain. IBM only gives certain members access to this blockchain, making it even more secure than the blockchain technology used in Bitcoin, for example. IBM offers this technology to all different types and sizes of companies, from fish purveyors to large scale retailers, like Walmart. They also use API technology. IBM utilizes multiple technologies, being one of the largest tech companies in the world. A few include IBM Informix, IBM ECM, IBM Guardium, and IBM SKLM, to name a few. IBM Foodtrust also uses multiple types of data, including:

* Master Data
* Business Transactions
* EPCIS Events
* Certificate Data
* Payload Data
* Cryptographic Signing

## Landscape

<p> IBM isn't a financial company per se, but they use technologies applied in the financial sector, and in this research, that is mostly blockchain. Some of IBM's biggest competitors include Accenture, Hewlett Packard, Wipro Technologies, Oracle, Dell and Amazon. Obviously blockchain usage has been growing over the last 5 to ten years, as well as API technology and IoT. IBM uses this tech in the implementation of it's Foodtrust program. One company that uses this technology similarly is Chronicled. Chronicled uses their own tech in the life sciences industry, but also uses blockchain to follow the supply chain and generate smart contracts between members. <p>

## Results 

<p> The Foodtrust has impacted different businesses greatly. In restaurants, it allows the chef to communicate where their product comes from directly to their guests, all by the guests scanning their phone on the menu to see where the product is from. This instills trust in the restaurant, increasing likelihood of return customers, increasing revenue. In manufacturing, it monitors product handling and storage. It alerts producers to food spoilage and shrinkage, thereby allowing farmers and producers to know how and when to ship, saving costs and preventing time wasted. In seafood, the tech tracks proper food handling processes, instilling trust in the producer on the customer end of the process, leveraging revenue and reducing waste costs. In agriculture commodities, it helps identify sourcing issues, especially in less developed countries with less regulations. It allows manufacturers to identify labor, fraud and sustainability issues by documenting all information relevant to the company of the Foodtrust blockchain. The Foodtrust also brings revenue back to farmers, as it allows farmers themselves to see where they can cut costs or cut out third parties within the chain itself. IBM is a  company that is performing well. IBM uses multiple metrics to measure success. The have multiple KPI's, including women in the workforce, energy conservation, first tier spending, and charitable contributions globally, which they measure by percentage. <p>

## Recommendations

<p> To be completely honest, I'm not sure if I know enough about the technology sector to give an answer to this prompt. I believe that in the thorough research I've done, IBM Foodtrust is utilizing multiple newer technologies, like blockchain, Iot, API's. They utilize smart contracts and use state of the art technology. They also work with other major companies, like Linux and Red Hat. My recommendation would be to advertise this system with a wider scope. I'm a food professional and the only reason I know about this revolutionary program is due to this Fintech program and the research I've done. I can almost guarantee many of my peers do not know about the Foodtrust program but would be eager to participate. Also to advertise more where consumers are concerned as well. I'd love to know where my food comes from when I make purchases at grocery stores or restaurants. I know many others who would be eager to take out their phone and scan a QR code to immediately see the source. In conclusion, my main recommentation boils down to visibilty. The tech that could be used in this would probably be API's. Connect directly to the consumer via apps or advertisements. <p>
